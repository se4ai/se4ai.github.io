title: " 4. Ethics : how"
layout: default
---

The premise of this book is that
AI tools offer a rich tapestry
of choices 
that
software engineers can weave
through to a variety of goals (and which can include ethical goals). 
This chapter offers specific examples of that process.

Our point will be that,
in the 21st century, the wise software engineering
knows how  different AI tools offer different services, and how some of those services
can achieve certain ethical goals.

Before continuing, we offer fair warning to the reader versed in the standard texts on, say, data mining.
The technologies discussed below roam far away from standard discussion of (say)
classification vs regression vs whatever else. Once we introduce ethical goals like inclusiveness or fairness
then the technology choices become very different.

## Current Ethical Concerns

The  [Institute for Electronics and Electrical
Engineers](/REFS#IEEEethics-2019) (IEEE) has   recently discussed general principles for
implementing autonomous and intelligent systems (A/IS).  They propose that the
design of such A/IS systems satisfy certain criteria:

1. _Human Rights:_ A/IS shall be created and operated to respect, promote, and protect internationally recognized human rights.
2. _Well-being:_ A/IS creators shall adopt increased human well-being as a primary success criterion for development.
3. _Data Agency:_ A/IS creators shall empower individuals with the ability to access
   and securely share their data, to maintain people’s capacity to have control over their identity.
4. _Effectiveness:_ A/IS creators and operators shall provide evidence of the effectiveness and fitness for purpose of A/IS.
5. _Transparency:_ The basis of a particular A/IS decision should always be discoverable.
6. _Accountability:_ A/IS shall be created and operated to provide
   an unambiguous rationale for all decisions made.
7. _Awareness of Misuse:_ A/IS creators shall guard against all potential misuses and risks of A/IS in operation.

Other  organizations, like [Microsoft](/REFS.md#microai-2019)
offer their own principles for AI:

- _Transparency_ AI systems should be understandable
- _Fairness_: AI systems should treat all people fairly
- _Inclusiveness_  AI systems should empower everyone and engage people
- _Reliability &amp; Safety_ AI systems should perform reliably and safely
- _Privacy & Security_: AI systems should be secure and respect privacy
- _Accountability_: AI systems should have algorithmic accountability

Ethics is a
rapidly evolving concept so it hardly surprising to say that mapping
the stated ethical concerns of one organization (Microsoft) into
another (IEEE) is not easy.  
Nevertheless,
the following table shows one way we might map together these two
sets of ethical concerns. Note that:

- "accountability" and "transparency"  appear in both the IEEE and Microsoft lists. Clearly these
  are concerns shared by many people.
- Missing from the Microsoft list is "effectiveness" but
  we would argue that what IEEE calls "effectiveness" can be expressed
  in terms of other Microsoft terms (see below).
- Assessed in terms of the Microsoft terminology, the IEEE goals or "well-being" and "awareness of misuse"
  are synonyms since they both reply on "fairness and "reliability and safely".


|                | Accountable|Transparent|Fairness |Rely+Safe|Inclusive|Private+Secure|
|Accountability  |  &#10004;  |           |         |         |         |              |
|Transparency    |            |  &#10004; |         |         |         |              |
|Well-being<br>+ aware of misuse||        | &#10004;| &#10004;|         |              |
|Human-rights    |            |           | &#10004;|&#10004; |&#10004; |              |
|Data agency     |            |           |         |         |&#10004; |   &#10004;   |
|Effectiveness   |   &#10004; |           |         |&#10004; |         |   &#10004;   |
{: border="1px" align=center }

The reader might dispute 
this  mapping, perhaps saying  that 
we have missed,
or missed out, or misrepresented, some vital ethical concern.  This  would be 
a good thing since that would mean you are now engaging in discussions about
software and ethics.
In
fact, the best thing that could happen below is that you say "that
is wrong; a better way to do that would be..."
As  George Box said,  all models
are wrong; but some are useful.  

In any case, what the above table does demonstrate is that:

- Large organizations are now very concerned with ethics. 
- When they talk about ethics, there is much overlap in what they say.
- This is a pressing need to extend our current design thinking for AI tools. Hence, this book.
 
## From Ethics to Algorithms

The above table maps between ethical concerns  from different organizations.
The rest of this chapter discusses how different algorithm choices enable these
ethical goals.  
These algorithms will be mentioned in brief (and for more details, see later in this book).

### Effectiveness



It is unethical to deliver an AI tool that is performing poorly,
particularly when there are so many ways to make an AI tool perform
better.  As discussed in our chapter on [Baselines](about-basleines),
no AI tool works best for all problems. Hence, we exploring new
problems, there must be a _commissioning_ process where different
AI tools are explored and/or adjusted to the local problem:

- AI tools come with defaults from their control settings. Those defaults may
be wildly  inappropriate for new problem.  For examples of this of this, see
Section 2 of [Nair et al.](REFS#nair-2018).  Hyperparameter optimizers are
tools for automatically finding tunings that can greatly improve effectiveness.
For examples of this, see [Fu et al.](REFS#fu-2016) and [Agrawal et
al.](REFS#agrawal-2018a). One way to implement such hyperparameter optimization
is via active learning (see below). 

XXX lime adjusting the nearest neibout count

The faster the algorithm,
the easier it is to fiddle with. So measured in terms of
_commissioning effort_,
 we prefer linear time methods (e.g.  Naive Bayes)
to very slow algorithms (e.g. KNN,  that scale very poorly to large 
data sets).

- Naive Bayes classifiers keep different statistics on rows of different
classes. When new data arrives, such a classier can be quickly updated, just by
adding to the stats of the class of that new row.  
- On the other hand, KNN algorithms make conclusions by interpolating between
the k nearest neighbors.  In practice, this is very slow since finding the
Kth-nearest neighbors requires a full pass over all the training data for each
new test instance.
- KNN can be made faster via clustering algorithms that group together similar examples.
  Once grouped, KNN only needs to within a group. 
- Just as an aside, clustering can be made very fast using tricks
like 
recursive random projections (RRP).
After a few random samples, it is possible to find two moderately distant points "_east,west_"
Data closest to "_east_" or "_west_" can clustered into two groups.
Repeating this recursively "_N"_ times generates a tree of clusters of depth "_N_",
the leaves of which holds
data that is 
similar according  to "_N_" random projections  over "_east,west_" pairs.

It is important to stress that the  commissioning   effort cannot be the only way we assess
an AI tool.  For high dimensional image data, deep learning] has
proved to be very effective.

- Deep learners are n-layered neural networks were layer "i" find
new features hat layer "i+1" uses to make new conclusions.

Training such learners can be a very slow process, so tuning and
comparing with other learners may be impractical.  In this book we
made no case that deep learning (or any other AI tool) is inherently
better or worse. Rather, our goal is to  map the trade-offs associated
with  AI tool such that the best one can be selected from the next
problem.


### Inclusiveness

AI tools that include humans in their reasoning process must do two things:

1. The humans must be be able to understand  why an AI tool has made a conclusion.  F
    - For this purpose, explanation algorithms are useful.
2. - Humans must be able to adjust that conclusion. 
    - For this purpose, active learning is useful.
3. Further, to better support the above, AI tools must understand and respect the goals of the humans involved in this process. 
    - For this purpose, multi-goal Pareto reasoning is useful.

 
#### Explanation

Inclusiveness is helped by AI tools that generate succinct human-readable
models since  humans can read and understand  such models.  Rule-based learners
like  contrast set learners and FFTrees are useful for generating such succinct
models:

![](/img/fft.png){: .imgright}

- According  to [George Kelly](REFS#kelly-1955), humans reason about the world
via lists of differences between things (as apposed to list of things abut each
object). This is an interesting since the list of obvious difference between
things can be [much shorter than a description of the
things](REFS#menzies-2003) (e.g. the difference between clouds and oceans is
that one you have to look up to see one of them).  Contrast set learners can
generate very short rules describing a domain by reporting the difference
between things, weighted by the frequency of each of difference. 
-   According to  [Gerd Gigerenzer](REFS@gigerenzer-2008), humans reason in a
"frugal manner"; that is, they ignore much of the available information to find
good-enough solutions[^simon].
      - A [frugal tree generator](REFS#phillips-2017) 
        ranks different divisions of data columns according the goal of the learning (e.g. for each division, how
   many positive/negative examples does in cover).  
      - Next, various   learning
biases are tested.  At every level of its tree building, FFtrees fork sub-trees
for
   two biases (the subsets of the data that do/do not match the worst/best division). 
       In this way, dividing "_N_" levels produces $$2^N$$ different
      trees.   The tree that performs best (on the training data) is then selected to apply to the test data. 
      - In practice, frugal trees  are binary trees of depth four or less. Humans can quickly glance at such
  trees, [then critique or apply them](REFS#gigerenzer-2008). Despite their small size, they can be [remarkably effective](REFS#chen-2018).

[^simon]: Gigerenzer's thinking was  influenced by the Nobel-Prize winning economist and AI pioneer Herbert Simon.  [Simon argued](REFS#simon-1956) that humans do make optimizer decisions, since such optimality assumes complete knowledge about a situation.  Rather, says Simon, humans reason via "satisficing" ( a portmanteau of satisfy and suffice) in which they seek solutions good enough for the current context.

![](/img/lime.png){: .imgright}

Another interesting approach  to explanation is to use locality reasoning.
The  [LIME explanation algorithm](REFS#riberio-2016) 
 builds some model $$M_1$$ using examples near the
example of interest (LIME does not specify which model is used). 
Next, LIMES builds a local regression mode $$M_2$$ using the predictions from $$M_1$$. The coefficients of $$M_2$$
are then informative as to what factors are most influential.
For example, in  the diagram at right, the example of interest is marked with a red cross and the $$M_2$$ coefficients
would reveal why this example is labeled (say) ref, not blue).


For a discussion of other explanation algorithms, see  [Gosiekska and Biecek](REFS#gos-2019).

#### Active Learning

Once a system can explain itself, then most probably humans will want to change some part of it.
Active learning is a general framework within which humans and AI can learn from each other, in
the context of specific examples.

- Active learners  incrementally build models using the minimum number of queries
  to some oracle (e.g. some human). 
     1. For example, if some as-yet-unlabelled examples fall near the decision
  boundary between two classes, then  the label for that example is _uncertain_. 
     2. One active learning stratefy is to
  ask the oracle about the next most uncertain example, the  update the model using that new information.
     3. Such learning strategies often dramatically descreses the number of examples
       need to build a ground truth or comission a model.
- Active learning is simpler when models can quickly update themselves.
    - Examples of such fast incremental update algorithms include Naive Bayes and RRP and many others besides.
- Sequential model-based optimization (SMBO) is an active learner that assumes it is fast to guess
  a value for a new example (if we have a model) but slow to confirm that guess (by running some oracle).
     - For example, when optimizing a data miner,
  SMBO might explore random settings to the control parameters of that learner. 
     - As it evaluates different
  settings, it builds  a model predicting the effect of a particular setting.
     -  The next setting it tries
  might be the one that is guessed to [achieve the highest predicted  score](REFS#nair-2018).


#### Multi-goal Pareto Reasoning

One of the lessons of research into requirements engineering is that the stakeholders for software
have many competing goals. 
Simple AI tools know how to chase a single goals (e.g. a classifier might try to maximize the accuracy
of its predictions).  Better AI tools now how to trade off between the multiple goals of competing stakeholders.

One way to trade-off between competing goals are multi-goal Pareto reasoners. 
Pareto frontiers were introduced in [Chapter 3](/about-tools#optimizers) in the section discussing
how data miners use optimizers. Recall that, given many solutions floating in a space of multiple goals,
the Pareto frontier are those solutions that are not demonstrably worse that anything else.

There many ways to implement multi-goal reasoning and one of the simplest is to use contrast set learning
and the [Zitler and Künnzli](REFS#zitler-2004) indicator measure "_I_":

- In the expression $$I(x,y)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_i^N \left(10^{w_i*(x_i'-y_i')/N}\right)$$
     -  $$x_i$$ and $$y_i$$ are the i-th goal of row $$x,y$$ 
     -  $$x_i'$$ and $$y_i'$$ are those goals normalized 0..1 for min..max. 
     - Each of the "_N_" goals is weighted $$w_i=-1,1$$ depending on whether or not we seek to minimize or maximze  it.
- When comparing two rows,  row $$x$$ is better than row $$y$$ if we "lose more"
  by going $$x$$ to $$y than if we go  $$y$$ to $$x$$; i.e.  `$$I(x,y) < I(y,x)$$`.
- Row are sorted by how many times they are better than
  (say) $$M=100$$ other rows (selected at random). 
- Contrast set learning can then be applied
  to discover what selects for the (say) 20% top scoring rows (while avoiding the rest).

Note that, in practice, we have seen
  this indicator measure [work well for up to 5 goals](REFS#sayyad-2013).

### Fairness

### Privacy and Security

prorotype generation.

### Reliability  and Safety
One an AI tools survives the commissioning process, it must be  monitored. Once again, as we stream
across newly arrived data, it is useful to deploy incremental learners that can quickly react to new data.

- One useful tool for monitoring is an anomaly detector that can report when new data is far and away removed
from the data seen so far.  Detecting such anomalies is important since we cannot trust an AI tool that encounters
something far removed from its previous experience. 
- One way to build an anomaly detector is to use RRP. As a side-effect of computing distance to each "_east,west_"
  pair in any cluster, we can collect the mean and standard deviation of all the distances seen in that cluster.
  With that information, we can declare something to be anomalous if its distance is   
  [more than "_N_" standard deviations away from the mean](REFS#peters-2019).
- Another way to build an anomaly detector is to continuing active learning (including SBMO) after the comissioning process.
  Anomalies can be reported when the predictions from active learning/SMBO do not
  match the newly incoming data.

    - see [Sayyad'13](REFS#sayyad-2013)

- Hyperparameter optimizers (again, like sequential model-based optimization);
- Explanation algorithms like LIME or frugal trees;
- Certification envelope technology such as prototype discovery and anomaly detection

- Clustering algorithms, and hierarchical clustering using recurisve random projections;
- Incremental learning that updates its models after seeing each new example.


For the industrial practitioner who wishes to distinguish themselves within the currently
crowded AI market, the above list might be a marketting opportunity. Spefically,
by augmenting their current toolkit with some of the above, they might be able
to offer services that is absent amongst their  rivals.

For the researcher who is an advocated of a particular AI tool,
the above list might inspire a research challenge.
First, they might seek ways  to extend their preferred AI tool
such that it covers the more of the above services.
Secondly, they might scoff at this list, saying "I can do better than that". If they then went on
to implement and evaluate their alternative, then that would be a very good thing
(since that would give us more material for version two of this book).

For us, this list is like a specification for an ideal "ethics machine". 
Later in this book we offer a version 0.1  implementation of that ethics machine.
As will be seen, that implementation requires much extension  and improvement.
Nevertheless, it does show that a surprisingly large portion of the above
can be created in a relatively simple manner. It is hoped that that implementation
seeds a research community devoted to exploring algorithms with ethical effects.
