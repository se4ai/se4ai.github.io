## One

According to Fatma Aydemir and Fabiano Dalpiaz
[listed numerous ethical issues](/REFS.md#aydemir-2018),
softare developers face numerous ethical choices in 
their
day-to-day work:

- _Privacy_: Handling, storing, sharing user data only under the circumstances and for the purposes that the user sets
- _Sustainability_: Energy consumption of the software artifact, caring about energy throughout the SE process and in the documentation
- _Transparency_: Transparent decision-making procedures of intelligent systems, publicly available ethics policies by software development organizations
- _Diversity_: Gender, race, and age distribution of professionals in a development team
- _Work ethics_: Decisions on which bugs to fix and how quickly, ensuring quality of the code before release
- _Business ethics_: Informing users of a changed business model, including revenue models
- _Accountability_: Who should be held responsible for the harm caused by software?
- _Dependability_: Decision to maintain and/or keep a software product in the market
- _Common goods_: Contributing to, using, promoting open source software

Pick any two of the above areas. For each area, write 2 or 3 lines about
how a software developers could make:

- An ethically positive decision in that area.
- An ethically negative decision in that area.

## Two

Suppose you decide that, ethically, you should produce software that:

- consumes limited energy;
- which produces models that humans can read, understand, and audit;
- which keeps human data safely secure.

Within that ethical context, list two design choices  that are 
ethically positive. Justify your conclusion (using 2-3 lines of text).

Repeat this exercise, this time for ethically negative choices.


## Three

The  [Institute for Electronics and Electrical Engineers](/REFS#IEEEethics-2019) (IEEE)
has   discussed general principles for implementing autonomous and intelligent systems (A/IS).
The IEEE makes the following points about A/IS:

1. _Human Rights:_ A/IS shall be created and operated to respect, promote, and protect internationally recognized human rights.
2. _Well-being:_ A/IS creators shall adopt increased human well-being as a primary success criterion for development.
3. _Data Agency:_ A/IS creators shall empower individuals with the ability to access 
   and securely share their data, to maintain peopleâ€™s capacity to have control over their identity.
4. _Effectiveness:_ A/IS creators and operators shall provide evidence of the effectiveness and fitness for purpose of A/IS.
5. _Transparency:_ The basis of a particular A/IS decision should always be discoverable.
6. _Accountability:_ A/IS shall be created and operated to provide
   an unambiguous rationale for all decisions made.  
7. _Awareness of Misuse:_ A/IS creators shall guard against all potential misuses and risks of A/IS in operation.  
8. _Competence:_ A/IS creators shall specify and operators shall adhere to the knowledge and 
   skill required for safe and effective operation.


Other  organizations, like [Microsoft](/REFS.md#microai-2019)
offer their own principles for AI:

- _Transparency_ AI systems should be understandable
- _Fairness_: AI systems should treat all people fairly
- _Inclusiveness_  AI systems should empower everyone and engage people
- _Reliability &amp; Safety_ AI systems should perform reliably and safely
- _Privacy & Security_: AI systems should be secure and respect privacy
- _Accountability_: AI systems should have algorithmic accountability

Draw a diagram that maps the IEEE guidelines into the Microsoft. Label each edge. Write one sentence
justifying each edge.

Note: there is no right answer for this one. Ethics is an evolving field; evidence:
the Aydemir and Dalpiaz list is different to the IEEE and Microsoft list.
One way we 
speed that evolution is to think hard about how all these terms connect.
