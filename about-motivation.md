This book is about using better software engineering to build better AI software. 
 AI is a very broad topic, discussed in
 [so](REFS.md#norvig-2009) 
 [very](REFS.md#grus--2019)
 [many](REFS.md#duda-2000)
 [other](REFS.md#witten-2016)
 books. So what makes this book so different?

Firstly,   by "better" AI software, 
we mean "ethically-aligned".
We assert that the design goals for SE-for-AI must be 
prioritize for human well-being.
It is ethical to improve
the profits of your company since that money becomes wages which
becomes groceries which becomes dinner so everyone and their kids
can sleep better at night.

It is also ethical to change the design
of AI software in order to ensure   that (say) the software is not
unduly discriminatory towards a particular social group (e.g. some
groups characterized by age, race, or gender). 
We suggest to you that when you start a new AI project,
your  first question should not be  be  "what data miners should I apply to this data?".
Rather, it should be  "what are the ethical requirements of this development? And how can we best support those requirements?".

Secondly, the authors of this book have spent decades applying many
AI tools ( mostly  for software engineering applications). We share
some of that case study experience in this book.

Thirdly,  we look
 at AI tools which,  recently, have had a major   impact on software
 engineering. Specifically, we will talk much about data mining
 algorithms; some about optimizers; and a little about theorem
 provers (and for more on these, see the [next chapter](about-tools) 

  

## Is "SE for AI" all that important?

  It is timely to talk about SE for AI. **AI software is still
  software** and   all  software
   (be it AI software, or otherwise) needs installation, configuration,
   maintenance, interfacing to other software, testing, certification,
   user support, usability additions, and packaging (for distribution).
   As shown below, Bill Benton from Redhat [reports
   that](REFS.md/#benton-2019) that when we look at the data mining
   pipelines used to distribute and scale AI tools, there is  much
   overlap between the activities of data scientists and   more
   traditional activities  like data engineer and application
   developer. That is, **AI software needs care and feeding by
   software engineers**.

Another reason to explore SE for AI is that **most "AI software"
   is not about AI**.   David Sculley  [offers the following
   diagram](REFS.md/#sculley-2015) showing the size (in lines of
   code) of  Google's software suite. Note how small is the AI box
   (shown in black), buried away in the middle of all the other
   software.

Since AI software is still software, it follows that **poor
   software engineering leads to poor AI**. Again, David Sculley
   [offers us an example of this](REFS.md/#sculley-2015).  He reports
   that Google's machine learning developers used all of the
   attributes in Google's data dictionaries to learn predictive
   models about browsing habits. This lead to problems since any
   subsequent change in the data dictionary meant that all the data
   mining had to be done, all over again. In software engineering
   terms, Google had introduce technical debt (i.e. something that
   will consume maintenance money at some future date) by violating
   principles of coupling and cohesion. Maintainable systems are
   loosely coupled (but internally, tightly cohesive). Google's
   classifiers, on the other hand were tightly coupled with their
   data dictionaries.  A better design, that would have looser
   coupling would have been to apply some sort of feature weighting
   to the data, and only connect to the least features that were
   most influential.

While poor software engineering can lead to problems with the AI,
the good news is that
   **better SE can lead to better AI**. For example, many industrial
   data scientists make extensive  use of the [Python scikit-learn
   toolkit](REFS.md#pedregosa-2011) data mining package. Started
   in 2007 as a Google Summer of Code project by David Cournapeau,
   numerous releases have appeared following a (approximately) three
   month cycle, and a thriving international community has been
   leading the development. At the time of this writing, over the
   last month, this software has been maintained and extended by
   dozens of authors, spread around the planet (specifically,
   excluding merges, 50 authors have pushed 119 commits to master
   and 119 commits to all branches to make changes thousands of
   lines of code in  279 files). All this is possible since
   scikit-learn uses state-of-the-art open source software engineering
   methods (continuous integration, cloud-based testing with Travis
   CI, git, github, etc etc).

Since good SE can lead to better AI, we devoted many  chapters of
this book to industrial data mining pipelines.   Recently we 
[reversed engineered](#REFS#amershi-2019) a nine-step pipeline for industrial machine learning.
For simplicity's sake, we draw it as steps that run left to right
(but in reality, **AI is an agile process** where we jump around
these steps, as required):

   We also surveyed many industrial data scientists to understand how much time they spend on different parts of this pipeline:


||hrs/week<br>(mean,<br>approx)||
|-----------:|---|-----------------------------------------------------|
|requirements|4.4|          ![](/img/black.png){:height="20px" width="94px"} |
|collection |4.7|           ![](/img/black.png){:height="20px" width="94px"} |

|feature engineering | 4.6|   ![](/img/black.png){:height="20px" width="92px"}|
|model training    |5.4|            ![](/img/black.png){:height="20px" width="108px"}|
|evaluation  |3.8|            ![](/img/black.png){:height="20px" width="76px"} |
|deployment  |5.1|            ![](/img/black.png){:height="20px" width="102px"}|
|monitoring  |2.6|            ![](/img/black.png){:height="20px" width="52px"}|

One interesting feature about the above histogram is that 
**most "data mining" is not about mining the data**.  We say this since, in  a 35 hour work week, only half a day (5.4.hours) was spent in _training_. This is interesting since most data mining textbooks _only_ talk about training. Hence, if we are going to talk SE for AI, there is a pressing need to discuss all the work that fills up the other four days of the week.  


## Quiz


Find papers in the recent SE literature that use:

- TERMS=  "software engineering and data mining"
- TERMS=  "software engineering and optimization"
- TERMS=  "software engineering and prover"


Method1: see if you can find your term in  [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.01550.pdf). If so, use references from this 
papers.

Method2:

- For TERM in TERMS, go to Google Scholar Advanced Search
    - For VENUE in one of {ICSE, FSE, ASE, "transactions software engineering", "Empirical Software Engineering", "Journal of Systems and Software", "Information Software Technologies"} do
         - Set "Return articles published in" to VENUE
         - Set "with all at least one the words" to TERM 
         - Set "with the exact phrase" set to "software engineering" to TERM 
         - Set "Return articles dated between" to the last ten years
         - Find a  paper that uses TERM in an interesting way. 
           Hint: only read paper with "enough" citations citations (for the last two years, "enough"=0; for anything
           before that, then "enough" for data mining =12 cites/year, "enough" for optimization is 6 cites/year, and for prover, 10 cites ever )
         - Sumamrize the paper under the following headings (usually, 2-3 lines each).

- Data labelling (if needed): any need to assign values to the data before anything else (e.g. "good project", "this is a bad poject"). How was it done? How were those labels checked? What was the effort in that labelling process?
- Training (if done): how was it done? Anything mentioned about issues with training? (e.g. long CPU times)
- Evaluation (if done): what metrics were applied (define each one)? how were the results summarized (list statistical tests and visualizations used). If cool visualizations, include them here.
