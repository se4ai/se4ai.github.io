## Show me the Code

## Show me the Process

Code is written by teams. Teams have processes. Some processes are bad (like the Waterfall model[^1]) and some processes are better
(like agile sprints[^2]). So while _show me the code_ is important, for those who have to manage teams of people working on SE for AI
systems, then it is also important to _show me the process_.

## Show me Examples

Where possible, show concrete examples of how AI technology
applies to SE (and vice versa). 

## Show me How to Innovate

Not black boxes. Here, current tools are seen as  mixes of methods that can be pulled apart and recombined and improved.
Data miners/optimizers are not black box devices that should be not explored or extended.
Rather,  data miners/optimizers are software and like all software they contain mistakes that need managing and mending and (as soon as we can) removing.

## Protect Limited/Expensive Resources

not enough to "do it aon the cloud". bad for science. bad for a resource-bound planet. bad for IOT.

## Notes

[^1]: Waterfall development is how the United States government used to organize very large and very expensive software projects. In the waterfall model,
managers plan without feedback from the domain; estimate delivery time without knowledge about how local programmers react to the tools and problem at hand;
and rarely readjust goals.

[^2]: Agile sprints is a common current industrial practice.
Given a backlog of current tasks, select the one(s) that offer most value at least cost to deliver. Sprint to finish those tasks
for the next day/week/month. At the end of that
time, come back to reconisder the current backlog to decide what should be the focus of the next sprint.
