## What is this site about?


### In the age of AI, what are the "12 steps" for Software Engineering?

In 2002 Joel Spolsky (CEO and co-founder of Stack Overflow)
published 12 checks for
 measuring how good a software team is. 
For the record, that list is:


-    Do you use source control?
-    Can you make a build in one step?
-    Do you make daily builds?
-    Do you have a bug database?
-    Do you fix bugs before writing new code?
-    Do you have an up-to-date schedule?
-    Do you have a spec?
-    Do programmers have quiet working conditions?
-    Do you use the best tools money can buy?
-    Do you have testers?
-    Do new candidates write code during their interview?
-   Do you do hallway usability testing?


This list was (is) very influential even though
 some of its advise is  questionable.
The value
of code interview questions (the second
last point) is is a matter of some debate[^1] but (and here we can assess
the impact of this list) those interviews are now standard practice[^2].

But you cannot argue with success. Software engineers (and their managers)
are busy people. Such busy people appreciate the value of (not too many)
heuristics to giude their work? So we asked ourselves,
for  SE in the age of AI, what are the 12 (or more) checks for testing in a
software team is successfully using/used-by  AI?

### Why? Refactoring AI for SE

So what should SE people need to know to best use AI?

Nevertheless, when discussing this work with colleagues,we are still sometimes asked if 
SE has any business mucking around with AI.
After all, it might be said, AI is a huge industy.
Can't software just use, off the shelf, the tools being geneated by the AI industry?

We reply that:

- It should be the goal of software developers to understand the strengths and weakness, and how to
mitigate those weaknesses, in their code.
- AI software is still software. All software, be it AI software, or otherwise
beeds maintenance, validation, interfacing to other software, and usability additions.
That is, AI software needs care and feeding by software engineers.

- Even if we think that AI is not our problem, our users may disagree. AI software is still software.
When users discover problems with software, 
or when they want things extended and improves,
it is the job of the person maintaining thatsoftware (i.e. a software engineer) to address that problem.

Most SE people d not deal with AI. So why talk about SE for AI? Well, in reply we say that waht we call
"software engienering" has changed over the years. And before all those changes, someone
said that "X" was not really softwae engineering:

- SE was not about  users (Dijkstra, 79)
- SE was not about testing (cleanroom, Mills, 1985)
- SE was not about requirements (Paulk, 1993)
    - “Analysis and allocation of the system requirements is NOT the responsibility of the SE group but is a prerequisite for their work”
- SE was not about deployment (before CI)


## Our Solutions


- favor symbolic representations
- healthy skecptims (want to read, reflect, doubt, revise, improve)
- want the code. want the code to be short
- not as hard as you might think.
- management needs mantras (so we will deliver)



### Who (are we)?

We are university researchers from NC State Unviversity who work extensively
with  industrial on industrial applications of AI.

Since 2014, this team has written five Ph.D.s and published extensively on
applciations that have significantly extended the prior state-of-the-art.

This web site was written by refactoring that work into a single framework,
then listing all the heuristics that select different parts of that framework.
