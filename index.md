The more SE people know about AI, the better they can apply this exciting new technology.

So, do you know enough about AI?

 use the kramdown markdown processor, which is the default. If you don’t know what I mean, it is ok, it means that you are using the default provided by GitHub Pages so you don’t need to worry about it.

Just use a double dollar sign $$ to escape LaTeX formulas

you can use an inline formula $$\forall x \in R$$ like this one
you can use an inline formula ∀x∈R
 like this one

or display a centered formula like this

$$
M = \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
x_{11} & x_{12} & \ldots \\
x_{21} & x_{22} & \ldots \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ldots \\
\end{array} \right)
$$
