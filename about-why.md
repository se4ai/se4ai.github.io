If you do not know how to build ethical AI software,
then you should read this book, 

More specifically, if you do not know how to design AI tools
that can address the following, then this is the book for you:


2. How stable is the performance of your AI tool ?
1. Have you compared the effectiveness of your AI tools against other options?
3. Can you report the dx/dy of your AI tool (i.e. if we change inputs _X_,
   how does that effect the outputs _Y_)?
3. Using that dx/dy knowledge, can you optimize your software to ensure most effectiveness?
4. Using that optimizer, can your AI tools chase a wide range of business goals?
4. Do you have a continuous monitoring process in place to ensure AI tool effectiveness?
5. Do you have a continuous repair process in place to mitigate for poor performance?
6. Does your AI tools  run
  fast enough, not use excessive minimal system resources, to enable such comparisons, stability
tests, optimization
  monitoring, and repair?
7. Do your AI tools ship with a "certification envelope" (so that its users
   know when not to trust it)?
8. Are you testing if your AI tools are  being unfair to different social groups?
9. Is your AI tool transparent enough to allow detection of misue??
10. Are your AI tools  accountable (transparent, reliable, and safe)?
11. Do your AI tools  support inclusiveness for its user population?
12. Are your AI  your tools private and secure?


A score of 12 is perfect, 11 is tolerable, but 10 or lower and you
have got serious problems. The truth is that most software organizations 
are running with a score of 2 or 3, and they need serious help.
So if you AI tools can't or won't answer "yes"
to the most of the above then:

- Industrial practitioners should use different tools; and 
- Researchers should accept  a new  research challenge (how how to enable that kinds of ethics in that kind of AI tool).


[^foot]: These questions are inspired by Joel Spolsky's 12 step test for the quality of a software team.  His test has 12 questions: (1) Do you use source control?; (2) Can you make a build in one step?; (3) Do you make daily builds?; (4) Do you have a bug database?; (5) Do you fix bugs before writing new code?; (6) Do you have an up-to-date schedule?; (7) Do you have a spec?; (8) Do programmers have quiet working conditions?; (9)  Do you use the best tools money can buy?; (10) Do you have testers?; (11_ Do new candidates write code during their interview?; (12) Do you do hallway usability testing?
