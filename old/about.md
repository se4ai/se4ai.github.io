### In the age of AI, what are the "12 steps" for Software Engineering?

Software engineers (and their managers)
are busy people. Such busy people appreciate the value of some
(but not too many)
heuristics to giude their work.

For example,
in 2002 Joel Spolsky (CEO and co-founder of Stack Overflow)
published 12 checks for
 measuring how good a software team is. 
This list was (is) incredibly  influential.
For the record, that list is:


-    Do you use source control?
-    Can you make a build in one step?
-    Do you make daily builds?
-    Do you have a bug database?
-    Do you fix bugs before writing new code?
-    Do you have an up-to-date schedule?
-    Do you have a spec?
-    Do programmers have quiet working conditions?
-    Do you use the best tools money can buy?
-    Do you have testers?
-    Do new candidates write code during their interview?
-   Do you do hallway usability testing?

**(NOTE TO SELF: when we get the heuristics written, we need to condense them into small N number of rules.)**

So we asked ourselves,
for  SE in the age of AI, what are the 12 (or more) checks for testing if a
software team is successfully using/used-by  AI?
To answer that question, we turned to our own experience.

Since 2014, this team has results in half a dozen Ph.D.s on SE for AI and AI for SE.
That work has been published extensively and has lead to
applciations that have significantly extended the prior state-of-the-art.

This web site was written by refactoring that work into a single framework,
then listing all the heuristics that select different parts of that framework.

Aside: One terrifying (and exhilirating) side effect of this week is that years of work can often be summed up with just a 
few rules of thumbs 

### This isn't SE

Most SE people do not deal with AI. Many are reluctant to add it in.
So why talk about SE for AI? Well, in reply we say that waht we call
"software engienering" has changed over the years. And before all those changes, someone
said that "X" was not really softwae engineering:

- SE was not about  users (Dijkstra, 79)
- SE was not about testing (cleanroom, Mills, 1985)
- SE was not about requirements (Paulk, 1993)
    - “Analysis and allocation of the system requirements is NOT the responsibility of the SE group but is a prerequisite for their work”
- SE was not about deployment (before CI)

Our point here is that even though AI is not a standard tool 
used and studied by 
software engineers, it will soon be. If you agree, then this site is for you.



### Why? Refactoring AI for SE

SE in the age of AI

SE is the agent of AI

how to deply AI methods to a wide audience? use se research. consider
the scilit-learn and eka toolkit, used by many. java, virual
machines. internt, nresearch on networks. open source communities. think of all the prior SE
resaerch and current SE practices that made
weka and scikit-learn possible.

When discussing this work with colleagues,we are still sometimes asked if 
SE has any business mucking around with AI.
After all, it might be said, AI is a huge industy.
Can't software just use, off the shelf, the tools being geneated by the AI industry?

We reply that:

- It should be the goal of software developers to understand the strengths and weakness, and how to
mitigate those weaknesses, in their code.
- AI software is still software. All software, be it AI software, or otherwise
beeds maintenance, validation, interfacing to other software, and usability additions.
That is, AI software needs care and feeding by software engineers.

- Even if we think that AI is not our problem, our users may disagree. AI software is still software.
When users discover problems with software, 
or when they want things extended and improves,
it is the job of the person maintaining thatsoftware (i.e. a software engineer) to address that problem.

## Our Solution

- Warning. there will be maths
- there will be heirstics grounded in deep principles of computation
- i.e. maths matters. deep principles matter.
- favor symbolic representations -- but w tae the forbus line here that symbols and maths go together (let the symbols help you divide the world to gudie your numeric analysis of the smaller bits)
- healthy skecptims (want to read, reflect, doubt, revise, improve)
- want the code. want the code to be short
- not as hard as you might think.
- management needs mantras (so we will deliver)
- not a textbook (a comprehensive coverage of all topics). 
  There are enough of those[^1]. And SE people can't/don't use all the details. Instead, what they need are hints, samplers, code snippets of useful
thngs that can suggest ways that they might add in useful ideas
for their local problems.

      is from [Russell and Norvig's "AI: A Modern Approach"](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)
