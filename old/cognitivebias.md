The Wikipedia page on “List of cognitive biases”1 lists nearly two hundreds ways that human reasoning is systematically biased. That list includes:

- Nearly a hundred decision-making, belief and behavioral biases such as atten- tional bias (paying more attention to emotionally dominant stimuli in one’s en- vironment and to neglect relevant data).
-  Nearly two dozen social biases such as the worse than average effect (believing that are we are worse than others at tasks which are difficult).
-  Over fifty memory errors and biases such as illusory correlation (inaccurately remembering a relationship between two events).

As documented by Simons and Chabris [407], the effects of these human imperfections can be quite startling. For example, in the “Gorilla in our midst” experiment, subjects were asked to count how often a ball was passed between basketball team wearing white shirts. Nearly half the subjects (48%) where so focused on “white things” that they did not notice a six foot hairy black gorilla walk slowly into the game, beat its chest, then walk out (see Figure 3.1). According to Simons and Chabris, humans can suffer from “sustained inattentional blindness” (which is a kind of cognitive bias) where they do not see effects that, to an outside observer, are glaringly obvious.

The lesson here is that when humans analyze data, their biases can make them miss important effects. Therefore, it is wise to run data miners over that same data in order to find any missed effects.
