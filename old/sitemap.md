- Ethics, Insight, and Explanations
    - Insight
        - Our goals is not models, but insight
        - grease to make the wheels of comprehension turn faster
        - models are important, but so are features
        - explanation also matters (needed to certify and debug these systems).
    - Ethics
        - What design patterns do we need to support the following?
        - IEEE ethically aligned design: prioritizing human well being with autonomous and intelligent systems
        - The microsoft 7
        - Reasonable1: a set of design patterns that address the IEEE and Microsoft goals
            - Not **the** way, just **one** way
            - A baseline implementation, to assist others in creating ethical-by-design AI-enhanced systems.
            - A way to recruit more people into the ethical army (hopefully, Reason1 will to irritate people into propose other, better,  methods)
        - Research questions
            - In the above, what are the common comptuational bottlenecks? ANd what can we do about them?
            - What's missing from the above? What are the potential pitfalls? how to mitigate that?
